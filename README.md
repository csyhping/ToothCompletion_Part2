# This is a project about tooth completion part 2. Currently under development.  
-----[[PART 1](https://github.com/csyhping/ToothCompletion.git)]-----  
√ Load the mesh  
√ Visualize the mesh  
√ Identify the boundary  
√ Select two vertex and create a straight line between them (mouse interaction)  
√ Create new vertices on the straight line base on the average edge length of the mesh (keyboard interaction)  
√ Construct the hole area  
√ Fit a plane for hole vertices  
√ Project the hole vertices to the plane  
√ Rotate the plane to a (x, y) plane  
√ 2D Delauney(triangulation & refinement)  
√ Project back to 3D  
√ Fairing  

-----[PART 2]-----  
√ Detect intersection  
? Adjust the intersection  
? Get the final result  
? Use script to process automatically with more data
